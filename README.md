# Portfolio Website

## Purpose
This project is my portfolio website.

## Stack
This project is based on this software stack:
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) for the HTML/JavaScript framework
- [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the CSS framework
- [**AWS Amplify**](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for auto-deploy to the Internet

## Setup
This project's setup depends on:
- Dependency management from `npm`/`npx`
- Intellisense from [Tailwind CSS integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- Formatting of HTML/JavaScript in VSCode

I also followed these guides:
- [Create-React-App and Tailwind setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
- [AWS Amplify for auto-deploy](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/)

## Build
If all dependencies were correctly installed, the project can be built and run with `yarn build`.

## Run
To run the app, use `yarn start`.
