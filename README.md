# Personal/Professional Website
This repository contains assets for my personal/professional website.

## Introduction
In the past, my website has always been slightly out-of-date from my current activities. As such, I decided to make this site focus on dynamic links to up-to-date content. Consider it more of a landing page steering people to my digital platforms instead of a full website.

## Includes
I opted to use an existing template for this site, and make adjustments as needed. The template comes from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/identity) and is used under their free-use license. Images included are either my own or used with licenses.

## Deployment
Since the site is statically served, I opted to host it on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) using S3. This keeps the update pipeline relatively simple.

## Futures
In the future, I may opt to extend the functionality of the site, possibly adding a self-hosted blog using tooling such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
